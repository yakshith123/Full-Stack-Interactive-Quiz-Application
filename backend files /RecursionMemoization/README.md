# Telusko Contest

This repository contains my entry for the Telusko Contest organized by the Telusko team and Navin Reddy sir. In this contest, I participated by creating a blog post and a video explaining different approaches to given assignment.

## Contest Details

The Telusko Contest is a 10-day challenge organized by the Telusko team and Navin Reddy sir. The challenge aims to encourage participants to showcase their knowledge and skills in various programming concepts. Each participant will submit their assignments and solutions throughout the 10-day duration.

#### Assignment 1 - Pascal's Triangle Explained

##### Video Explanation

I have created a video titled "Pascal's Triangle Explained: Iteration, Memoization, and Recursion" where I provide a comprehensive explanation of different approaches to generate Pascal's Triangle. In this video, I cover the concepts of iteration, memoization, and recursion, highlighting the advantages and applications of each approach. You can watch the video on YouTube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSJW3mle1PU) and join me on this educational journey.

### Blog Post

To complement the video, I have written a detailed blog post titled "Mastering Pascal's Triangle: Exploring Iteration, Memoization, and Recursion". The blog post delves into the concepts of Pascal's Triangle and provides an in-depth explanation of the three programming approaches. It discusses the algorithms, code implementation, advantages, limitations, and applications of each approach. You can read the blog post on Medium [here](https://medium.com/@jbhanu718/mastering-pascals-triangle-exploring-iteration-memoization-and-recursion-83e0d1e2d17e).
