#### Day 4 - React App Integration with Spring Boot Backend [Assignment - 4]

##### Video Explanation

For Day 4 of the assignment, I have created a video demonstrating the integration of a React app with a Spring Boot backend. In this video, I showcase the process of connecting a React frontend to a Spring Boot backend by utilizing RESTful API endpoints. The backend is built on top of Spring Boot, and the PostgreSQL database is used as the data storage. I walk you through the code and explain how to establish the connection, fetch data from the backend, and update the UI accordingly. You can watch the video on YouTube [here](https://youtu.be/3Ow6Nv5v8eg) to learn more.

##### Repository Link

The frontend code for the React app can be found in a separate repository [here](https://github.com/bhanujoshi24/product). Please refer to this repository to access the React frontend code.

##### Blog Post

To supplement the video, I have written a detailed blog post titled "Building a Full-Stack Application with React and Spring Boot". The blog post provides a step-by-step explanation of Integrating React App, Spring Boot, and PostgreSQL. The blog post includes code snippets, explanations, and best practices for implementing CRUD operations. You can read the blog post on Medium [here](https://medium.com/@jbhanu718/building-a-full-stack-application-with-react-and-spring-boot-5feff19c9e17) to gain a deeper understanding of the topic.

#### Day 5 - Reflection in Java

##### Blog Post
