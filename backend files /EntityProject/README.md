# Telusko Contest

This repository contains my entry for the Telusko Contest organized by the Telusko team and Navin Reddy sir. In this contest, I participated by creating a blog post and a video explaining different approaches to given assignment.

## Contest Details

The Telusko Contest is a 10-day challenge organized by the Telusko team and Navin Reddy sir. The challenge aims to encourage participants to showcase their knowledge and skills in various programming concepts. Each participant will submit their assignments and solutions throughout the 10-day duration.

#### Assignment 1 - Pascal's Triangle Explained

##### Video Explanation

I have created a video titled "Pascal's Triangle Explained: Iteration, Memoization, and Recursion" where I provide a comprehensive explanation of different approaches to generate Pascal's Triangle. In this video, I cover the concepts of iteration, memoization, and recursion, highlighting the advantages and applications of each approach. You can watch the video on YouTube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSJW3mle1PU) and join me on this educational journey.

##### Blog Post

To complement the video, I have written a detailed blog post titled "Mastering Pascal's Triangle: Exploring Iteration, Memoization, and Recursion". The blog post delves into the concepts of Pascal's Triangle and provides an in-depth explanation of the three programming approaches. It discusses the algorithms, code implementation, advantages, limitations, and applications of each approach.

#### Assignment 2 - Stream API and Additional Product Functions

##### Video Explanation

For Day 2 of the assignment, I have created a video explaining the Stream API in Java and demonstrating its usage. In this video, I cover the basics of the Stream API, including how to create streams, perform intermediate and terminal operations, and leverage the functional programming features of the API. Additionally, I showcase the implementation of two additional functions: fetching product details based on place and filtering out-of-warranty products using both a traditional `for-each` loop and the Stream API. You can watch the video on YouTube [here](https://youtu.be/2wYEL_MJJ-k) to learn more.

##### Blog Post

To supplement the video, I have written a detailed blog post titled "Exploring the Power of Stream API in Java: Fetching Product Details and Filtering Out-of-Warranty Products". The blog post provides an in-depth explanation of the Stream API, its features, and benefits. It also includes code examples and step-by-step explanations of fetching product details based on place and filtering out-of-warranty products using both a `for-each` loop and the Stream API. You can read the blog post on Medium [here](https://medium.com/@jbhanu718/stream-api-and-additional-product-functions-in-java-b922509e071e) to gain a deeper understanding of the topic.

By watching the video and reading the blog post, you'll have a solid grasp of the Stream API in Java and how to utilize it for various data processing tasks, as demonstrated through the example functions for fetching product details and filtering out-of-warranty products.
